## 🧭 Tech Lead Elevator Pitch (1-minute)
```
I'm a Senior Backend Engineer with over 7 years of experience building scalable, distributed systems using Java, Spring Boot, and Golang. I’ve owned backend services from design to production and led initiatives involving service decoupling, performance tuning, and observability.
Over the last few years, I’ve naturally grown into a leadership role — mentoring engineers, guiding architecture, and being the go-to person during incidents. I’m excited to take the formal step into a Tech Lead role, especially at the RDC, where I can help grow the team’s capabilities, bridge alignment with HQ, and push for local innovation that drives global impact.
```

## 👋 VP: Tell me about yourself and why you’re interested in stepping into a Tech Lead role at our RDC.
`You`:
```
I'm currently a Senior Backend Engineer with over 5 years of experience building backend services, distributed systems, and scalable APIs using Java and Spring Boot.
I’ve taken on informal leadership roles — driving architectural discussions, mentoring junior engineers, leading sprints, and owning the end-to-end delivery of several projects. Stepping into the Tech Lead role at the RDC feels like a natural evolution. I'm particularly excited to help grow technical capabilities here, drive quality engineering practices, and align delivery with strategic business outcomes across regions.
```

## 🛠️ VP: What’s your approach to making technical decisions as a lead?
`You`:
```
I combine data-driven insights with team collaboration. First, I understand the business requirements and constraints. Then I evaluate options considering scalability, maintainability, and risk.
I involve senior engineers early in the decision-making process to foster alignment and buy-in. I document trade-offs and guide the team toward a balanced decision, ensuring we’re not over-engineering but also not accruing unnecessary debt. I also advocate for prototyping in areas with high uncertainty.
```

## 🌐 VP: As a Tech Lead in an RDC, how would you ensure the team isn't just executing tasks from HQ, but driving innovation locally?
`You`:
```
It starts with building trust and credibility through consistent, high-quality delivery. Once that's in place, I encourage the team to think beyond Jira tickets — ask why, challenge assumptions, and suggest alternatives.
I create space for local tech spikes or innovation sprints — small proofs-of-concept that demonstrate our capability to lead. I also ensure we participate in architecture guilds, RFCs, and product ideation sessions to give RDC engineers a voice at the table.
```

## 📊 VP: What metrics do you track as a Tech Lead to ensure the health of your team and systems?
`You`:
```
For systems: I monitor latency (P95), error rates, throughput, and uptime using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing. I also track deployment frequency and MTTR for reliability.
For the team: I look at sprint velocity, code review throughput, incident ownership, and burnout signals like unplanned work spikes. I regularly hold retros and 1:1s to assess morale and align on growth paths. These help balance delivery with team well-being.
```

## 🔧 VP: How do you handle situations where your team disagrees with your technical direction?
`You`:
```
I welcome technical disagreement — it often leads to better solutions. I create a safe space for discussion, encourage data-backed arguments, and facilitate structured design reviews.
If there’s still no consensus, I involve a third-party reviewer or suggest a small spike to compare approaches. Ultimately, if a decision must be made quickly, I take responsibility and communicate clearly why we're choosing a path — while remaining open to iterating later.
```

## 🧠 VP: Give an example of how you’ve mentored or upskilled someone on your team.
`You`:
```
One junior dev was struggling with understanding microservice communication patterns. I paired with them to design a service that used async messaging with Kafka. I walked them through designing events, ensuring idempotency, and handling retries.
Later, they were confident enough to lead a related feature on their own. I also created internal tech talks around event-driven design, which helped raise the overall backend maturity in the team.
```

## 🔥 VP: A production issue affects users in 3 regions. What do you do?
`You`:
```
First, isolate and identify — check logs, metrics (CPU/memory), and traces using tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and distributed tracing (Jaeger).
If it’s region-specific, I’ll verify if it’s infra, DNS, or DB replication lag. I’ll initiate an incident response channel, coordinate rollback or mitigation, and communicate status updates across regions and stakeholders.
Post-resolution, I’ll lead a root cause analysis and push for an action plan to prevent recurrence — whether infra hardening, circuit breaker tuning, or alert improvements.
```

## 🧑‍💻 VP: How do you mentor and grow backend engineers?
`You`:
```
I tailor growth paths based on each engineer’s strengths and goals — for example, helping someone move from writing features to owning service modules.
I use pairing sessions, async feedback on PRs, and encourage internal knowledge sharing. I also assign ‘stretch tasks’ like designing a small service or leading sprint demos to help them build leadership and technical depth.
```

## 🧩 VP: How do you ensure architectural decisions are aligned globally while empowering your local team?
`You`:
```
I maintain transparency by documenting local architectural choices and aligning them with global patterns via RFCs or architecture councils.
When we explore new patterns or tech, I run PoCs with the team and present learnings to HQ. This builds trust and gives our RDC team a sense of ownership and contribution to global standards.
```
