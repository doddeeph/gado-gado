title Refresh-Ahead Caching

actor Client
participant "App Service" as App
participant "Cache (with TTL + Refresh)" as Cache
participant "Database" as DB
participant "Scheduler / Background Job" as Refresher

== Client Reads Cached Data ==
Client -> App : GET /resource/123
App -> Cache : GET key:resource:123
alt Cache HIT
    Cache --> App : Return cached value
    App --> Client : 200 OK
else Cache MISS
    Cache --> App : MISS
    App -> DB : SELECT * FROM resource WHERE id=123
    DB --> App : DB result
    App -> Cache : SET key:resource:123 TTL=5min
    App --> Client : 200 OK
end

== Background Refresh Happens Before Expiry ==
Refresher -> Cache : Check TTL for key:resource:123
alt TTL < threshold (e.g., <30s)
    Refresher -> DB : SELECT * FROM resource WHERE id=123
    DB --> Refresher : Result
    Refresher -> Cache : Refresh key:resource:123 TTL=5min
else TTL still long
    Refresher --> Cache : Skip refresh
end
