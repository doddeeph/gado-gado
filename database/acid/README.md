# Let's explain ACID properties using a real-world banking scenario — transferring money between two bank accounts.

## 🏦 Scenario: Transferring $100 from Alice’s account to Bob’s account
- Alice has $500, Bob has $300.
- Alice initiates a $100 transfer to Bob.
- This process is a transaction in the database.

### ✅ 1. Atomicity – "All or nothing"
- The transaction involves:
  1. Deducting $100 from Alice's account.
  2. Adding $100 to Bob's account.
- If any part fails (e.g., system crashes after step 1), the entire transaction is rolled back.

#### 📌 Real-world result:
- Alice will not lose money if Bob doesn’t get it.
- Either both actions succeed, or none do.

### ✅ 2. Consistency – "Rules are always followed"
- The total money in the system should remain the same:
    Before: $500 (Alice) + $300 (Bob) = $800
    After: $400 (Alice) + $400 (Bob) = $800
- If Alice's balance would drop below zero (e.g., trying to send $600), the system detects the violation and prevents the transaction.

#### 📌 Real-world result:
- No transaction can break business rules like negative balance, duplicate entries, or wrong data types.

### ✅ 3. Isolation – "Transactions don’t interfere"
- Suppose two people try to:
  - Alice sends $100 to Bob.
  - Alice also pays $200 for a bill.
- Both transactions run at the same time.
- Isolation ensures they don’t interfere and execute as if they happened one after the other.

#### 📌 Real-world result:
- No matter how many transactions run simultaneously, Alice’s balance is always accurate.
  
### ✅ 4. Durability – "Once done, it’s permanent"
- Once the bank confirms the transaction and shows success:
  - Even if the power goes out or the system crashes, the data is safely stored.
  - On restart, Alice's and Bob’s balances will reflect the completed transaction.

#### 📌 Real-world result:
- You never lose money because of a crash after the transaction was completed.

## 🧾 Summary Table:
| **ACID Property** | **What it ensures**                  | **In our banking example**                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Atomicity**     | All steps succeed or none do         | Alice isn't charged unless Bob is credited |
| **Consistency**   | Data always follows business rules   | Balance doesn’t go negative                |
| **Isolation**     | Transactions don’t affect each other | Multiple transfers don't clash             |
| **Durability**    | Once committed, data is safe forever | Transaction persists after crash           |
