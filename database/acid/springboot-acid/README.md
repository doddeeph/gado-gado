## üîÅ Testing the Transaction
1. Start the Spring Boot app.
2. Go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console (JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:bankdb).
3. Check balances:
   ```
   SELECT * FROM ACCOUNTS;
   ```
4. Make a transfer:
   ```
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"from":"Alice","to":"Bob", "amount": 100}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transfer
   Transfer successful
   
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"from":"Alice","to":"Bob", "amount": 600}' http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transfer
   Insufficient funds
   ```
5. Refresh H2 console ‚Äî balances will update if successful.
6. Try forcing a failure by uncommenting the simulated error ‚Äî check that balances are not changed (atomic rollback).

## ‚úÖ Updated Example: Demonstrating Isolation
### üß™ Expected Output (in logs):
```

```

‚úÖ Only one thread should succeed, because isolation level `REPEATABLE_READ` prevents dirty/non-repeatable reads of Alice's balance between the two concurrent threads.

### üîç Isolation Levels Recap:
| Level             | Prevents                             | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `READ_COMMITTED`  | Dirty reads                          | Default in many DBs             |
| `REPEATABLE_READ` | Dirty + non-repeatable reads         | Ensures same data is read again |
| `SERIALIZABLE`    | Phantom reads, most strict isolation | Full transaction isolation      |

### ‚úÖ Summary
- The `@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.REPEATABLE_READ)` ensures isolation.
- Simulated concurrency shows transactional conflicts.
- You can switch to `Isolation.READ_COMMITTED` to observe race conditions.
