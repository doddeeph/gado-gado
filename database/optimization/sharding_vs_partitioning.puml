title Sharding vs Partitioning

' Sharding (Application-Level Split)
node "Application Router" as Router {
  database "Shard 1" as Shard1
  database "Shard 2" as Shard2
  database "Shard 3" as Shard3
}

Router --> Shard1 : User ID 1–1000
Router --> Shard2 : User ID 1001–2000
Router --> Shard3 : User ID 2001+

note right of Router
  SHARDING: App logic handles routing
  Scales horizontally across databases
end note

' Partitioning (Database-Level Split)
node "Partitioned Orders Table" {
  database "Orders Table" as OrdersMain
  frame "Partition Jan" as PartJan
  frame "Partition Feb" as PartFeb
}

OrdersMain --> PartJan
OrdersMain --> PartFeb

note right of OrdersMain
  PARTITIONING: DB engine handles split
  One logical table with internal partitions
end note
