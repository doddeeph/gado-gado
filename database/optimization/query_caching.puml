title Query Caching â€“ Cache-Aside Pattern

actor User
participant "App Server" as App
participant "Redis / Memcached" as Cache
database "Database" as DB

User -> App : Request data (e.g., /users/123)
App -> Cache : GET user:123
Cache --> App : Miss (null)
App -> DB : SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123
DB --> App : User Data
App -> Cache : SET user:123 with TTL
App --> User : Return User Data

== Next Request ==
User -> App : Request data (again)
App -> Cache : GET user:123
Cache --> App : Hit (User Data)
App --> User : Return Cached Data
