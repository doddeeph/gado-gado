# Agile
Agile is a software development methodology (and mindset) focused on delivering value quickly and iteratively through collaboration, adaptability, and customer involvement.

## Key Characteristics of Agile
| **Aspect**                      | **Description**                                                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Iterative Development**       | Work is broken into short cycles (e.g., 1–2 week sprints).                |
| **Customer Collaboration**      | Customers are involved throughout the project for feedback and direction. |
| **Responding to Change**        | Agile teams embrace changes even late in development.                     |
| **Continuous Delivery Working** | Tested software is delivered frequently (every few weeks or faster).      |
| **Cross-Functional Teams**      | Teams have all the skills needed (e.g., devs, testers, designers).        |
| **Continuous Improvement**      | Regular retrospectives help teams improve processes.                      |

## Popular Agile Frameworks
* **Scrum**: Uses Time-boxed sprints, roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev Team.
* **Kanban**: Focuses on visualizing workflow, continuous delivery and limiting WIP (Work in Progress).
* **XP (Extreme Programming)**: Adds engineering practices like TDD, Pair Programming, CI.
* **SAFe**, **LeSS**: Scaled Agile for larger organizations.

## Agile Manifesto (Core Values)
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Typical Agile Workflow (Scrum Example)
* **Product Backlog** – List of features, fixes, and tasks prioritized by the Product Owner
* **Sprint Planning** – Team selects work for the sprint
* **Sprint (1–4 weeks)** – Team builds and tests features
* **Daily Stand-up** – Short meeting to sync progress
* **Sprint Review** – Demo of what’s been built
* **Sprint Retrospective** – Discuss improvements for next sprint

## Benefits of Agile
* Faster time-to-market
* Better product-market fit
* Higher quality through early testing
* Stronger team ownership and collaboration
* Flexibility to pivot as needs change
